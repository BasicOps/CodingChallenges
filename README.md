# BasicOps Software Engineering Coding Challenges
Thanks for your interest in joining the team as BasicOps!  As part of our interview process, we ask candidates to do a small coding exercise so that we can get to know each other a bit from a technical perspective.  These challenges aren't intended to be laborious, multi-day efforts, but rather reasonably quick projects to give us an idea of how you solve technical problems relevant to the position you are applying for.  If you find yourself spending more than an few hours on any of these challenges, you might be overthinking your solution.

## Submission Instructions ##
1. Fork this project on github.
2. Complete the project specified for the role you are applying for
3. Push all your changes back to the fork and submit a pull request
4. Email your recruiter to indicate you've completed the challenge and include:

## Alternative Submission Instructions ##
If you prefer that your coding challenge submission remain private (as this is a public github repository), please create a patch file and email to your recruiter.
